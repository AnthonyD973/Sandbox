To run, unfortunately, one needs to close all Chrome tabs and launch Chrome with web security disabled. Don't browse the web with Chrome until you close and reopen it. To disable web security, open Chrome from a terminal with:

    chrome --disable-web-security --user-data-dir

Under my Linux, chrome is located under `/opt/google/chrome`.
